# Aerial Image Segmentation for Illegal Logging Detection and Forest Conservation
Forest preservation is a critical component of global environmental protection initiatives. Forest ecosystems provide invaluable ecological services, including carbon sequestration, biodiversity support, and climate regulation. In this project, we explore the application of image segmentation techniques to aerial imagery to detect forested and non-forested areas accurately. The project involves preprocessing and augmenting a dataset of aerial forest images, implementing multiple segmentation models (including UNet, SegNet, and FCN variations), and evaluating their performance using various metrics. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of using these techniques for forest monitoring, with potential applications in conservation, detecting deforestation, and monitoring logging activities.
